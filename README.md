# authentication

A simple full stack web app for practice using PHP, mySQL database, and Javascript. The web app requires users register, and by doing so their credentials
are stored in a table.
A user's information will be authenticated during a login attempt. If login is succesful, they will be directed to the main page where they can upload 
recipes to there cookbook. The application uses security measures to combat session fixation, and HTML and SQL injections. Javascript is used to 
dynamically validate user input.
